Karabiner Elements Complex modifications for having fn layer from HHKB on rMBP keyboard


Couldn't live without my custom HHKB layout so I brought over the keys I used a lot and ended up accidentally pressing on the build in keyboard.

*Using OSX built-in modifier key remapping, changed Caps Lock to Left Control
Remappings:
fn + WASD cluster becomes Arrow key cluster
fn + k = home
fn + , = end
fn + l = page up
fn + . = page down
